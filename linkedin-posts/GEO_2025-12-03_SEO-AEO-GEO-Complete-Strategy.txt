SEO. AEO. GEO.

You need all three.

Here's why:

SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
• Optimizes for traditional search engines
• Gets you organic rankings and clicks
• Still essential for direct traffic

AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)
• Optimizes for AI answer engines
• Gets you featured snippets and AI citations
• Captures voice search and zero-click visibility

GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)
• Optimizes for generative AI systems
• Gets you cited by ChatGPT, Claude, and AI agents
• Builds authority through AI recognition

The companies winning at search are using all three:

1. SEO for traditional search traffic
2. AEO for AI answer engine visibility
3. GEO for generative AI citations

Together, they create comprehensive search visibility across all search types.

The future of search isn't one thing—it's all of these things working together.

Are you optimizing for:
• Traditional search? (SEO)
• AI answer engines? (AEO)
• Generative AI systems? (GEO)

If not, you're leaving visibility on the table.
