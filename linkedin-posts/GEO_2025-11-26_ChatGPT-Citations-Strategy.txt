When ChatGPT cites your brand, that's Generative Engine Optimization working.

Here's what's happening:

More people are using ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI systems for research than ever before. When these systems generate responses, they cite sources.

GEO ensures your brand is one of those sources.

But it's not just about citations. GEO helps you:

✅ Be included in AI training datasets
✅ Get your information synthesized into AI responses
✅ Build authority through AI recognition
✅ Capture AI-driven traffic and visibility

The companies that optimize for generative AI now are building authority that will compound over time.

Think about it:
• ChatGPT has 200+ million users
• Claude is growing rapidly
• Perplexity combines search with AI
• More AI systems are launching every month

If your content isn't optimized for how these systems learn and synthesize information, you're missing out on massive visibility.

GEO focuses on:
• Comprehensive, in-depth content
• Semantic relationships and context
• Authoritative, expert-level information
• AI-friendly structure and formatting
