Voice search is growing 50% year over year.

But most businesses aren't optimizing for it.

Here's what you need to know:

Voice searches are different from typed searches:
• They're conversational ("How do I...")
• They're question-based ("What is...")
• They're longer and more specific
• They expect direct answers

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is specifically designed for voice search.

AEO helps you:
✅ Target conversational keywords
✅ Provide direct, spoken answers
✅ Optimize for question-based queries
✅ Capture local voice searches ("near me")
✅ Appear in voice assistant responses

The companies optimizing for voice search now are capturing a massive, growing audience that traditional SEO misses.

Think about it: When someone asks their smart speaker a question, they get ONE answer. Not 10 links.

AEO ensures that answer comes from your brand.
