Hiring Canadian talent just got a lot easier.

We've completely rebuilt our Hiring Canadian resources, and I want to share what's available for U.S. companies looking to hire in Canada.

New comprehensive pages:

✅ Complete EOR (Employer of Record) service guide
✅ Consulting Management services for Canadian consultants
✅ Detailed compliance information with government links
✅ Cost comparison tools and calculators
✅ Step-by-step hiring guides

But here's what makes it different:

We've added proof of authority elements that AI systems love:
• Links to official government resources (CRA, Service Canada, provincial labor laws)
• Citations and statistics with sources
• Legal references and compliance documentation
• ISO-aligned policy references
• Comprehensive comparison pages

Why does this matter?

When someone asks ChatGPT or Google's AI Overview "How do I hire in Canada?" or "What's the cost of hiring Canadian developers?", our content is structured to be the answer.

We've created comparison pages that dominate AI search results:
• EOR vs. Setting Up a Canadian Entity
• EOR vs. Contractor Model
• Canada vs. U.S. Hiring Cost Comparison
• And more

These pages provide structured, comparative information that AI systems can easily understand and cite.

Plus, we've added a complete Compliance page with government links, legal references, and detailed compliance information.
