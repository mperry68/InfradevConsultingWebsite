Your Customers Are Using ChatGPT for Research. Is Your Business Part of the Conversation?

Here's a stat that should get your attention: 50% of knowledge workers now use AI like ChatGPT for research instead of traditional search.

When someone asks ChatGPT about your industry, your services, or your competitors, what does it say?

If your content isn't optimized for generative AI systems, ChatGPT might not even know you exist. Or worse, it might be learning about your industry from your competitors.

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) ensures your content is:
• Discovered by generative AI systems
• Learned from and included in AI knowledge bases
• Cited when AI generates responses
• Synthesized into comprehensive answers

The difference between GEO and traditional SEO?

SEO: Optimize for search engines
GEO: Optimize for AI systems that learn from and create content based on your information

As more people use ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini for research, businesses that optimize for generative AI will have a massive advantage.

The question is: Will your business be part of the AI's knowledge base, or will your competitors be the only ones it knows about?
