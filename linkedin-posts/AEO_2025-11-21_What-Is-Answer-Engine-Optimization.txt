What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?

If you're still only focusing on traditional SEO, you're missing a huge opportunity.

AI-powered answer engines like Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, and voice assistants are changing how people search. They don't just return links—they provide direct answers.

AEO is the practice of optimizing your content to be selected, understood, and cited by these AI systems. It's about:

✅ Appearing in featured snippets
✅ Being cited in AI-generated answers
✅ Capturing voice search queries
✅ Getting zero-click brand visibility

The difference? Traditional SEO gets you clicks. AEO gets you visibility even when users don't click through.

As more people use AI assistants and voice search, AEO becomes essential for staying visible in search results.

Is your content optimized for how AI systems understand and present information?
