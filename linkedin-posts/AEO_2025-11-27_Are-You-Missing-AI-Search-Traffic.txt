Are You Missing 40% of Your Potential Search Traffic?

Here's a reality check: Over 40% of searches now trigger AI-generated answers. If you're only doing traditional SEO, you're invisible to a massive segment of your audience.

When someone asks Google's AI Overview, Perplexity, or a voice assistant a question, they get a direct answer—often without ever clicking through to a website.

The problem? Most businesses haven't optimized for this.

Your competitors who have optimized for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) are:
• Getting cited in AI-generated answers
• Capturing zero-click brand visibility
• Appearing in voice search results
• Establishing authority in AI-powered search

The question isn't whether AI search will become dominant. It already is.

The question is: Will your business be visible when AI systems answer questions about your industry?

If you're not sure, you're probably missing out.

We help businesses optimize their content for AI-powered answer engines. Want to know if your content is AEO-ready?
