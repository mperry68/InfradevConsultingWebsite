Voice Search: The $40 Billion Opportunity Most Businesses Are Ignoring

"Hey Siri, what's the best way to hire Canadian developers?"

"Alexa, tell me about EOR services."

Voice search is exploding. By 2025, voice commerce is projected to reach $40 billion. But most businesses are still optimizing for typed queries, not spoken questions.

Here's what you need to know:

Voice search queries are different:
• More conversational and natural
• Longer and more question-based
• Often local ("near me" queries)
• More likely to trigger AI-generated answers

If your content isn't optimized for voice search, you're missing a massive opportunity.

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) includes voice search optimization:
• Natural language targeting
• Question-based content structure
• Local optimization
• Featured snippet optimization

The businesses that optimize for voice search now will have a significant advantage as voice search continues to grow.
