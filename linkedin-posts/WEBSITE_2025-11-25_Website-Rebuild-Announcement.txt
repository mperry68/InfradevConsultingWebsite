We've completely rebuilt our website, and I'm excited to share what's new.

After months of work, InfraDev now has a modern, comprehensive website that better reflects who we are and what we do.

What's new:

✅ Complete redesign with a professional, modern look
✅ New Search Optimization services (SEO, AEO, GEO)
✅ Comprehensive Hiring Canadian resources and guides
✅ New blog with SEO-optimized content
✅ Resource hub with downloadable guides and checklists
✅ Improved navigation and user experience
✅ Mobile-optimized design
✅ Enhanced compliance and authority documentation

But here's what I'm most excited about: We've built this site with AI search in mind.

Every page is optimized for how AI systems understand and present information. We've added structured data, comprehensive FAQs, comparison pages, and proof of authority elements that help AI systems cite us as a trusted source.

This isn't just a website refresh. It's a complete transformation designed for the future of search.
