Why Answer Engine Optimization matters more than ever

Google AI Overviews. Perplexity. ChatGPT. Voice assistants.

These aren't the future of search—they're the present.

Here's what's happening:

🔍 40% of searches now happen through voice assistants
🔍 Google AI Overviews appear in 84% of search results
🔍 Users trust AI-generated answers more than traditional search results

If your content isn't optimized for how AI systems extract and present information, you're invisible to a growing portion of your audience.

AEO isn't about gaming the system. It's about:

• Answering questions directly and clearly
• Structuring content so AI can understand it
• Providing authoritative, fact-based information
• Using schema markup to help AI systems parse your content

The companies that optimize for AI answer engines now will dominate search visibility in the coming years.

Are you ready to be one of them?
