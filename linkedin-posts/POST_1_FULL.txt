Big News: We Just Launched Our New Blog & Resource Hub

U.S. companies, we've got something game-changing for you.

After working with dozens of U.S. companies hiring Canadian talent, we noticed a pattern: everyone was asking the same questions.

"How do I hire in Canada without forming a Canadian entity?"
"What's the difference between W-2 and Canadian T4 forms?"
"How much can I really save hiring Canadian developers?"

So we built something to answer all of these questions—and more.

Introducing our new Blog & Resource Hub:

We've created 6 comprehensive guides covering everything from EOR services to payroll compliance, plus free downloadable resources including checklists, templates, and process diagrams. You'll also find real salary data and cost savings calculations (spoiler: it's 30-50% savings) along with step-by-step compliance guides for U.S. companies hiring Canadians.

What you'll learn:
• How to hire Canadian talent in 48 hours (no entity formation needed)
• Complete payroll compliance guide (Canada vs. U.S.)
• The true cost savings of hiring Canadian developers
• Employment law differences (W-2 vs. T4, contractor vs. employee)
• Full compliance checklist for U.S. employers

Why this matters:

Most U.S. companies think hiring in Canada means 3-6 months of entity formation, $20,000-$48,000 in setup costs, and complex compliance headaches.

The reality with EOR services? 48-hour onboarding, no entity formation required, full compliance handled for you, and 30-50% cost savings on employment.

We've made hiring Canadian talent simple, fast, and compliant.
