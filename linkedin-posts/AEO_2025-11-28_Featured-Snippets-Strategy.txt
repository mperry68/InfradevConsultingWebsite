The featured snippet is the new #1 ranking position

Here's why:

When Google shows a featured snippet, it gets 8.6% of all clicks. But more importantly, it gets 100% of the visibility.

That's the power of Answer Engine Optimization.

Featured snippets aren't just for traditional search anymore. They're also:
• Used by Google AI Overviews
• Read by voice assistants
• Displayed in AI-generated answers
• Shown in conversational search results

To capture featured snippets, your content needs to:

1. Answer questions directly (40-60 words)
2. Use clear, scannable formatting
3. Include FAQ schema markup
4. Provide comprehensive, authoritative answers
5. Structure content with proper headings

The best part? You don't need to rank #1 organically to get featured snippets. You just need to be the best answer.

AEO helps you optimize for these zero-click opportunities that still drive massive brand visibility.
