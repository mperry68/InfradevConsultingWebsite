What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?

While SEO optimizes for search engines and AEO optimizes for answer engines, GEO optimizes for something entirely different: generative AI systems.

ChatGPT. Claude. Gemini. Perplexity.

These AI systems don't just find your content—they learn from it, synthesize it, and generate new responses based on it.

GEO is the practice of optimizing your content to be:
• Discovered by generative AI systems
• Learned from and included in training data
• Cited when AI generates responses
• Synthesized into comprehensive answers

The key difference:

Traditional SEO: Get clicks
AEO: Get visibility in AI answers
GEO: Get your brand cited and synthesized by AI

As more people use ChatGPT and Claude for research, companies that optimize for generative AI will have a massive advantage.

GEO isn't about keywords or rankings. It's about:
• Creating comprehensive, authoritative content
• Building semantic richness
• Establishing expertise and authority
• Making your content AI-friendly

The future of search is generative. Is your content ready?
