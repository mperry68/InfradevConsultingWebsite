New data: U.S. companies save 30-50% hiring Canadian developers

We analyzed hundreds of hiring scenarios and found:
• Junior developers: $50k-$70k CAD
• Mid-level developers: $70k-$95k CAD  
• Senior developers: $95k-$120k CAD (without track record)

But here's what most companies don't know: Traditional entity formation takes 3-6 months and costs $20k-$48k in setup. EOR services? 48 hours, zero entity formation.

We just launched our Blog & Resource Hub with complete cost savings analysis, payroll compliance guides (Canada vs. U.S.), employment law breakdowns, and free downloadable resources.
