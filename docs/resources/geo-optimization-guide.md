## Understanding Generative AI Systems

Generative AI systems create new content by learning from and synthesizing information from web sources. Unlike traditional search engines that return links, or answer engines that extract answers, generative AI systems:

- Learn from your content
- Synthesize information from multiple sources
- Generate new responses based on learned information
- Cite sources when generating content
