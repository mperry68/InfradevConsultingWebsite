					<h2>What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?</h2>
					<p>Generative Engine Optimization is the practice of optimizing your content to be discovered, understood, and cited by generative AI systems that create new content based on web sources.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-grid">
					<div class="content-card">
						<h3>The Rise of Generative AI Search</h3>
						<p>Traditional search engines return links. Generative AI systems create new content—synthesizing information from multiple sources to generate original responses. GEO optimizes your content to be one of those sources that generative AI systems learn from and cite.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="content-card">
						<h3>Why GEO Matters</h3>
						<p>Millions of users now use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other generative AI systems as their primary search interface. These systems generate responses by learning from web content. If your content isn't optimized for generative AI discovery and understanding, you're invisible to this growing user base.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="content-card">
						<h3>GEO vs. AEO vs. SEO</h3>
						<p>SEO optimizes for traditional search rankings. AEO optimizes for answer engines that extract and cite sources. GEO optimizes for generative AI systems that learn from, synthesize, and create new content based on your information. Each requires different optimization strategies.</p>
