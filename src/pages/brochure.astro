						<button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq-answer-1">
							<span>How long does it take to see SEO results?</span>
							<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
						</button>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-1">
							<p>SEO is a long-term strategy. Typically, you'll start seeing improvements in 3-6 months, with significant results appearing after 6-12 months of consistent optimization. Technical fixes and site speed improvements may show results sooner, while keyword rankings and organic traffic growth take longer to develop.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq-answer-2">
							<span>What's included in your SEO service?</span>
							<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
						</button>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-2">
							<p>Our SEO service includes keyword research and management, professional content writing (including French localization), technical SEO fixes, site speed optimization, mobile optimization, Google Analytics setup, monthly blog creation (2 posts per month), backlink building (optional at $70/link), and comprehensive monthly reporting with KPI dashboards.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq-answer-3">
							<span>Do you work with existing content or create new content?</span>
							<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
						</button>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-3">
							<p>We do both. We'll optimize your existing pages for focus keywords and improve on-page SEO elements. Additionally, we create two new blog posts every month as part of our content strategy to build authority and target long-tail keywords.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq-answer-4">
							<span>What is keyword density and why is it important?</span>
							<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
						</button>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-4">
							<p>Keyword density refers to how often a focus keyword appears on a page relative to the total word count. We maintain a 2-3% keyword density to ensure your content is optimized for search engines without appearing spammy. This helps search engines understand what your page is about while maintaining natural, readable content.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq-answer-5">
							<span>How do you handle bilingual content (English and French)?</span>
							<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
						</button>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-5">
							<p>We have dedicated content writers who can create and optimize content in both English and French. This is particularly valuable for Canadian markets or businesses serving bilingual audiences. We ensure proper localization, not just translation, to maintain SEO effectiveness in both languages.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="faq-item">
						<button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq-answer-6">

						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-6">
							<p>We address broken links, remove low-quality backlinks, fix critical site errors, simplify redirect chains, optimize images, implement proper meta tags and Open Graph tags, manage sitemaps and robots.txt files, and improve Core Web Vitals for better site performance.</p>

						<button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq-answer-7">
							<span>How do you measure SEO success?</span>

							<span>What's the difference between SEO and paid advertising?</span>
							<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
						</button>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-9">
							<p>SEO focuses on earning organic (free) search rankings through content optimization, technical improvements, and authority building. Paid advertising (PPC) involves paying for immediate visibility in search results. SEO provides long-term, sustainable results, while PPC offers immediate but temporary visibility. Many businesses use both strategies together.</p>
