					<h2>What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?</h2>
					<p>Answer Engine Optimization is the practice of optimizing your content to be selected, understood, and cited by AI-powered answer engines and voice assistants.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-grid">
					<div class="content-card">
						<h3>The Shift to AI Search</h3>
						<p>Traditional SEO focuses on ranking in search results pages. AEO focuses on being selected as the source for AI-generated answers. When users ask Google's AI Overview, Perplexity, ChatGPT, or voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, these systems need to extract information from web content to provide direct answers.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="content-card">
						<h3>Why AEO Matters Now</h3>
						<p>Over 40% of searches now trigger AI-generated answers. Users increasingly rely on AI assistants for quick, direct responses rather than clicking through to websites. If your content isn't optimized for AI understanding, you're missing a massive and growing segment of search traffic.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="content-card">
						<h3>How AEO Differs from SEO</h3>
						<p>SEO optimizes for human readers and search engine algorithms. AEO optimizes for AI systems that need to understand context, extract facts, and synthesize information. AEO requires structured data, clear semantic meaning, and content that answers questions directly and comprehensively.</p>

					<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
					<p>When AI systems generate answers, they typically cite only a few authoritative sources. Being one of those cited sources means you capture visibility even when users don't click through to your website. AEO ensures your content is structured and optimized to be that authoritative source.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="services-grid">
					<div class="service-card">
						<h3>Content Structure Optimization</h3>
						<p>Restructure your content to be AI-friendly: clear question-answer formats, hierarchical information architecture, and direct responses to common queries. We ensure your content can be easily parsed and understood by AI systems.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="service-card">
						<h3>Semantic Markup & Schema</h3>
						<p>Implement advanced schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, QAPage, Article) that helps AI systems understand your content's meaning, context, and structure. This increases the likelihood of being selected as a source.</p>
					</div>

					</div>
					<div class="service-card">
						<h3>Voice Search Optimization</h3>
						<p>Optimize for conversational queries and natural language questions. Voice assistants and AI search engines use different query patterns than traditional search. We optimize for "how," "what," "why," and "when" questions.</p>
					</div>

						<p>Optimize content to appear in Google's featured snippets and AI Overviews. This includes concise answers, bullet points, tables, and structured formats that AI systems can easily extract and present.</p>

					<div class="service-card">
						<h3>Conversational Content Strategy</h3>
						<p>Develop content that answers follow-up questions and provides comprehensive coverage of topics. AI systems often need to understand context and relationships between concepts to generate accurate answers.</p>

							<p>Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of optimizing your content to be selected, understood, and cited by AI-powered answer engines and voice assistants.

							<span>How is AEO different from SEO?</span>
							<span class="faq-icon">+</span>

						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-2">
							<p>SEO optimizes for search engine algorithms and human readers, focusing on ranking high in search results pages.

							<span>Why do I need AEO if I already have SEO?</span>
							<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
						</button>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-3">
							<p>Over 40% of searches now trigger AI-generated answers. Users increasingly get direct answers from AI systems without clicking through to websites. AEO ensures your business appears in these AI-generated answers, capturing visibility even when users don't visit your site. SEO and AEO work together—SEO gets you clicks, AEO gets you visibility in the age of AI search.</p>

							<span>What platforms does AEO optimize for?</span>
							<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
						</button>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-4">
							<p>AEO optimizes for AI-powered answer engines including Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, ChatGPT (with web search), Microsoft Copilot, and voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. The goal is to ensure your content is selected and cited when these systems generate answers to user queries.</p>

							<span>How long does it take to see AEO results?</span>
							<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
						</button>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-5">
							<p>AEO results can appear faster than traditional SEO because AI systems continuously crawl and evaluate content. You may start seeing your content appear in AI-generated answers within 1-3 months, though this varies based on your industry, competition, and the quality of your optimization efforts.</p>

							<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
						</button>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-6">
							<p>Content optimized for AEO should directly answer common questions, be structured with clear Q&A formats, provide concise direct answers (40-60 words), use semantic markup, and demonstrate authority through E-E-A-T signals (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness). Featured snippets and voice search optimization are also crucial.</p>

							<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
						</button>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-7">
							<p>No, AEO should complement your SEO strategy, not replace it. A comprehensive search strategy includes both SEO (for traditional rankings) and AEO (for AI-powered answer engines). Together, they ensure your business captures visibility across all evolving search interfaces.</p>

							<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
						</button>
						<div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-8">
							<p>We measure AEO success through tracking when your content appears in AI-generated answers, monitoring featured snippet appearances, tracking voice search visibility, measuring zero-click brand visibility, and analyzing citation frequency in AI responses.
