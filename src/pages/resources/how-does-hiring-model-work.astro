					<h1>How Does the Canadian Hiring Model Work?</h1>
					<p class="hero-subtitle">
						The Employer of Record (EOR) model allows U.S. companies to hire Canadian talent without forming a Canadian entity. Here's how it works, step by step, and what it means for your business.

					<p>
						The Employer of Record (EOR) model is a streamlined approach to cross-border hiring that eliminates the complexity of international employment. Instead of forming a Canadian company, registering with tax authorities, and managing compliance yourself, an EOR acts as the legal employer while you maintain full control over day-to-day work.

					<p>A simple, transparent process from start to finish</p>
				</div>
				<div class="process-steps">
					<div class="process-step">
						<div class="step-number">1</div>
						<h3>You Find the Talent</h3>
						<p>You identify and select the Canadian professional you want to hire. You conduct interviews, evaluate skills, and make the hiring decision—just like you would for any employee.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="process-step">
						<div class="step-number">2</div>
						<h3>We Become the Legal Employer</h3>
						<p>InfraDev Consulting enters into an employment contract with the candidate as the Employer of Record. We handle all Canadian employment compliance, legal obligations, and administrative requirements.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="process-step">
						<div class="step-number">3</div>
						<h3>You Manage the Work</h3>
						<p>You maintain full control over day-to-day work, project assignments, performance evaluation, and team integration. The employee works for you, reports to you, and delivers work to you—we just handle the employment paperwork.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="process-step">
						<div class="step-number">4</div>
						<h3>We Handle Compliance</h3>
						<p>We process payroll, remit taxes (CPP, EI, income tax), generate T4 slips, handle benefits administration, and ensure compliance with all Canadian employment laws and regulations.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="process-step">
						<div class="step-number">5</div>
						<h3>You Receive One Invoice</h3>
						<p>Each month, you receive one simple invoice covering the employee's salary, employer contributions, and our service fee. No hidden costs, no surprises—just transparent, predictable billing.</p>

						<h3>Day-to-Day Management</h3>
