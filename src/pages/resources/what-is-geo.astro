					<h1>What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?</h1>
					<p class="hero-subtitle">
						Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of optimizing your content to be discovered, understood, and cited by generative AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other AI platforms that create new content based on web sources. As generative AI becomes the primary search interface, GEO ensures your business is part of the AI knowledge base.

						While SEO optimizes for search engines and AEO optimizes for answer engines, GEO optimizes for something entirely different: generative AI systems. These AI systems don't just find your content—they learn from it, synthesize it, and generate new responses based on it. GEO is the practice of optimizing your content to be discovered, learned from, and cited by these generative AI platforms.

					<p>The evolution from search engines to generative AI systems</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content-grid">
					<div class="content-card">
						<h3>Traditional SEO vs. AEO vs. GEO</h3>
						<p><strong>SEO</strong> optimizes for traditional search rankings. The goal is to appear in the top 10 organic results and get users to click through to your website.</p>
						<p><strong>AEO</strong> optimizes for answer engines that extract and cite sources. The goal is to appear in featured snippets, AI Overviews, and voice assistant responses.</p>
						<p><strong>GEO</strong> optimizes for generative AI systems that learn from, synthesize, and create new content based on your information. The goal is to become part of the AI's knowledge base and be cited in generated responses.</p>
						<p>The key difference: <strong>SEO gets you clicks. AEO gets you visibility in AI answers. GEO gets your brand cited and synthesized by AI.</strong></p>
					</div>
					<div class="content-card">
						<h3>How Generative AI Systems Work</h3>
						<p>Generative AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity work differently than traditional search engines or answer engines:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>They learn from web content to build knowledge bases</li>
							<li>They synthesize information from multiple sources</li>
							<li>They generate original responses based on learned information</li>
							<li>They cite sources when generating responses</li>
							<li>They prioritize comprehensive, authoritative content</li>
						</ul>
						<p>GEO optimizes your content to be that authoritative source that generative AI systems learn from and cite when generating responses.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="content-card">
						<h3>Why GEO Matters Now</h3>
						<p>Millions of users now use ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini as their primary search interface. These systems generate responses by learning from web content. If your content isn't optimized for generative AI discovery and understanding, you're invisible to this growing user base.</p>
						<p>When generative AI systems learn from your content, you become an authority in their knowledge base. When they cite you, you get visibility. When they synthesize your information, you get reach—even without direct clicks.</p>

					<h2>Key Elements of Generative Engine Optimization</h2>
					<p>What makes content GEO-friendly</p>
				</div>
				<div class="elements-grid">
					<div class="element-card">
						<h3>1. Comprehensive Content Coverage</h3>
						<p>Create comprehensive content that covers topics in depth. Generative AI systems prefer sources that provide complete, authoritative coverage rather than fragmented information. Comprehensive content is more likely to be learned from and cited.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="element-card">
						<h3>2. Semantic Richness</h3>
						<p>Enhance content with rich semantic meaning, context, and relationships. Generative AI systems need to understand not just facts, but how concepts relate to each other. Semantic richness helps AI systems better understand and synthesize your content.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="element-card">
						<h3>3. Authority Signals</h3>
						<p>Establish clear expertise and authority signals. Generative AI systems prioritize content from authoritative sources. Proper attribution, author credentials, citations, and quality signals are essential for GEO.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="element-card">
						<h3>4. AI Training Data Optimization</h3>
						<p>Structure content to be easily included in AI training datasets. Use clear patterns, consistent formatting, and comprehensive coverage that AI systems can easily learn from and reference.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="element-card">
						<h3>5. Citation Optimization</h3>
						<p>Structure content to be easily citable by generative AI systems. This includes clear attribution, source links, data citations, and formats that AI systems recognize as authoritative and trustworthy.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="element-card">
						<h3>6. Multi-Modal Content</h3>
						<p>Optimize for AI systems that process text, images, tables, and structured data. Ensure your content works across all modalities that generative AI systems can understand and synthesize.</p>
