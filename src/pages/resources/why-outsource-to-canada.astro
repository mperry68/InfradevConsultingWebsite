					<h2>Top Benefits of Outsourcing to Canada</h2>
					<p>Why U.S. companies choose Canada over other outsourcing destinations</p>
				</div>
				<div class="benefits-grid">
					<div class="benefit-card">
						<h3>Significant Cost Savings</h3>
						<p>U.S. companies typically save <strong>10-40% on employment costs</strong> when hiring Canadian talent compared to equivalent U.S. positions. This includes lower salary expectations, reduced benefit costs, and favorable exchange rates, while maintaining high-quality standards.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Lower salary expectations for equivalent roles</li>
							<li>Reduced benefit and overhead costs</li>
							<li>Favorable USD to CAD exchange rate</li>
							<li>No need for expensive U.S. office space</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="benefit-card">
						<h3>Time Zone Alignment</h3>
						<p>Canada shares time zones with the United States, enabling real-time collaboration, same-day communication, and seamless project management. Teams can work together during normal business hours without the delays common with offshore outsourcing.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Overlapping business hours for real-time collaboration</li>
							<li>Same-day response times</li>
							<li>No overnight delays in communication</li>
							<li>Easier scheduling for meetings and standups</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="benefit-card">
						<h3>Cultural Compatibility</h3>
						<p>Canadian professionals share similar work culture, business practices, and communication styles with U.S. teams. This cultural alignment reduces misunderstandings, improves collaboration, and accelerates project delivery.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Similar business communication styles</li>
							<li>Shared work ethics and professionalism</li>
							<li>Fluent English (and often French) speakers</li>
							<li>Understanding of North American business culture</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="benefit-card">
						<h3>Highly Skilled Tech Talent</h3>
						<p>Canada produces world-class software developers, engineers, and technical professionals. With strong computer science programs, tech hubs in Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal, and a growing AI/ML ecosystem, Canada offers access to top-tier talent.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Strong computer science and engineering programs</li>
							<li>Growing AI, machine learning, and cloud expertise</li>
							<li>Experience with modern frameworks and technologies</li>
							<li>Tech hubs in major cities (Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal)</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="benefit-card">
						<h3>Legal and Compliance Advantages</h3>
						<p>Hiring in Canada through an Employer of Record (EOR) eliminates the need to form a Canadian entity, register with tax authorities, or manage complex compliance. This legal simplicity makes Canadian outsourcing faster and more accessible than traditional international hiring.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>No Canadian entity formation required</li>
							<li>EOR handles all compliance and payroll</li>
							<li>Familiar legal framework for U.S. companies</li>
							<li>Strong intellectual property protections</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="benefit-card">
						<h3>Proximity and Travel</h3>
						<p>Canada's proximity to the United States makes in-person meetings, team building, and collaboration much easier than with offshore destinations. Same-day travel is possible, and there are no visa requirements for U.S. business travel.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Easy same-day travel between countries</li>
							<li>No visa requirements for business travel</li>
							<li>Convenient for in-person meetings and team building</li>
							<li>Reduced travel costs compared to offshore destinations</li>
