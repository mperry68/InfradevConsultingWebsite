Hiring Canadian developers offers U.S. companies significant cost savings while maintaining high quality standards. But understanding the true cost difference requires looking beyond base salaries to total cost of employment, including taxes, benefits, and operational expenses. This guide provides a comprehensive cost analysis.

## Executive Summary: The Cost Advantage

U.S. companies hiring Canadian developers typically save **10-40% on total employment costs** compared to hiring equivalent U.S. talent. These savings come from:

- Lower base salaries (15-30% lower)
- Lower employment taxes (slightly lower)
- Favorable exchange rates (USD to CAD)
- Lower benefits costs (in some cases)
- Reduced competition for talent

**Key Point**: Cost savings don't come at the expense of quality.

## Hidden Cost Factors

### Exchange Rate Considerations

**Current Exchange Rate** (2024): ~1 USD = 1.35 CAD

**Impact**:
- When USD is strong: Additional 5-10% savings
- When USD is weak: Reduced savings (but still significant)

**Mitigation**: Many EOR providers allow payment in USD, handling currency conversion.

### Benefits Cost Differences

**Health Insurance**:
- **U.S.**: $6,000-$12,000 per employee annually
- **Canada**: $2,000-$4,000 per employee annually (supplementary benefits)
- **Savings**: $4,000-$8,000 per employee

**Retirement Plans**:
- **U.S.**: 401(k) match typically 3-6% of salary
- **Canada**: RRSP match typically 3-5% of salary
- **Similar Costs**: Comparable

### Recruitment Costs

**U.S. Market**:
- High competition for talent
- Longer time-to-fill (30-60 days average)
- Higher recruitment fees (15-25% of salary)
- Signing bonuses common

**Canadian Market**:
- Less competition (still competitive, but less than U.S.)
- Similar time-to-fill (30-60 days)
- Similar recruitment fees (15-25% of salary)
- Signing bonuses less common

**Savings**: Primarily from reduced competition and less need for signing bonuses.

## EOR Service Costs

### EOR Fee Structure

Typical EOR service fees:
- **Per Employee**: $500-$1,500/month
- **Percentage of Salary**: 2-5% of gross salary
- **Flat Fee**: Varies by provider

**Example**: $600/month per employee = $7,200 annually

**Included Services**:
- Payroll processing
- Tax compliance
- Benefits administration
- HR support
- Employment law compliance

**Cost-Benefit**: EOR fees are typically offset by:
- Elimination of entity formation costs ($20,000-$48,000 first year)
- Reduced compliance risk
- Time savings (no need to become Canadian payroll expert)
- Operational simplicity
